How to use it?
=> First you need to install the require modules mentioned above. There is main.py file where the UI is made and some features the mail sending part is in email_func.py(just telling if you want to add more features and Yes i gave you permission to do it :) ). And make sure  that every file is in same folder than just run the main.py file. After running it there are a settings button at the right top corner , click it and fill your Gmail credentials there (it is safe you can read the code your pass and mail id will be safe) and a IMP thing!!! you need to on less secure app in your mail id which you will use for sending mails. 

Okay now come back to main window there would be 2 sections one will be single section and other bulk if you want to send single mail then you can do it easily. Now talking about the main feature bulk one. If you want to send bulk email (means send a same message to different people you can do ) you need to have a excel file and you need to name the column  "email" (IMP!!). then there is a browse button browse your excel file and (after clicking to the bulk option)  write your message and subject and just click the send button. Now you can enjoy this software
